# Current task:
* Add sequencing

# Todo list
NOTE: This todo list is far from finished, and more will probably be added in the future,
as I think of more things to add to the project. Also, as I work on some features I will
get more specific tasks to do, which I will then add to the todo list.

## "Code parser"
* Add multi-file support
* Design some more good syntax(like multiple files)

## Sequencing
* Add midi import support?

## Synth engine
* Filters
* Normalizing
* Make a macro to make it easier to add more node types
* Add multithreading, suggestion: Make it "layer" based, i.e. we start by giving sections of the synth
    that have nothing to do with each other to different threads, then we put the values that are
    needed by other parts into a list. Then we hand that list to each 2:nd layer synth, and multithread
    the running of the 2:nd layer synth. Then we do the 3:rd, 4:th, 5:th e.t.c. layer until finished.
    The layer of synth is determined like this: A synth can only depend on values generated by
    synths in a lower level. And that's pretty much it. This would however make synths a lot
    more complicated, as they would have to be chopped up into pieces. Should be doable, though.
* Optimize internal synth structures
 * Const expressions, i.e. constant func running on constants can be evaluated at startup.

## Live play
* Live play, play until a stop command is typed, like "exit" or smth
* Allow for hot reloads of files, i.e. check if the last changed date
  has updated, and if it has, recompile the files and replace the synth
  to the updated version. Find some way to make the transition smooth too,
  for example fade in/fade out. 

## Export
* Export mp3
* Export ogg
* Export different variables instead of just "left" and "right"
