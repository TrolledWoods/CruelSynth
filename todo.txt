# Current task:
* Split into tokenizer, parser e.t.c
 * Compile into a synth

# Todo list
NOTE: This todo list is far from finished, and more will probably be added in the future,
as I think of more things to add to the project. Also, as I work on some features I will
get more specific tasks to do, which I will then add to the todo list.

## "Code parser"
* Design some more good syntax

## Sequencing
* Add sequencing
* Add midi import support?

## Synth engine
* Make a macro to make it easier to add more node types
* Optimize internal synth structures
 * Const expressions, i.e. constant func running on constants can be evaluated at startup.
* "Probes", variables can be probed in order to get a history of their values.
            This should allow delays to be more efficient, as multiple delays can
	    use the same probe if they are delaying the same value
  + Optimization: If a probe is defined for the variable "x",
          a delay is defined as "delay ($x, 1.0)", and another is set
	  as "delay (+ ($x, 1.0), 1.0)", then change this occurance to "+(1.0, delay($x, 1.0))" so that
	  the same probe can be used for both delays. The point of this
	  is that, we should probe values as far "in" as possible, if constant
	  are added or multiplied onto a value that is probed, we can simply
	  move those operations outside of the delay without changing the result,
	  and in return get fewer probes in total.

## Export
* Export mp3
* Export ogg
* Export different variables instead of just "left" and "right"
